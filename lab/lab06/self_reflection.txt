You must answer at least 4 questions, but the remaining ones are optional. The main goal of this file is to get you thinking critically about your own work, but we will also use these self reflections at the end of the semester when we do our internal review of the course.

ArrayDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: I could have used recursion in addFirst code.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: I used % to get the nextFirst.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: I could have used get(i) to get a content in the ArrayDeque.

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing ArrayDeque?

A:

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing ArrayDeque, if anything?

A: The fact that we can use % to get the nextFirst. It took so much time to come up with this idea.

Q: If you wrote ArrayDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A:

LinkedListDeque:

Q: Give an example of at least one idea from the staff solution that would have made your solution better (if any).

A: I used if and else in my addFirst and addLast code, but I found that I did not have to use if and else.

Q: What's something you felt proud of in your code, if anything?

A: It did not take much time to come up with the idea of getRecursive method.

Q: What's something that was particularly inelegant in your code, if anything?

A: I used a lot of dots to access to some nodes what I want to access, such as sentinel.next.next.prev = sentinel;

Q: What did you learn by talking to your partner about writing LinkedListDeque?

A: I did not need to write 'sentinel.next.next.prev = sentinel;' to access some code, I could have access

Q: What do you wish you would have known before writing LinkedListDeque, if anything?

A: I did not need to use if and else in my addFirst and addLast.

Q: If you wrote LinkedListDeque again, what would you do differently, if anything?

A: I want to simplify my removeFirst and removeLast code.

Meta:

Q: Did you like this design review process? Anything we should do differently next time?

A: It was good to review my code and know
